# dotfiles
ZSH, Tmux and ssh setup on both local/remote machines.

## Installation

### Step 1
Install dependencies (e.g. oh-my-zsh and related plugins)


```bash
# Install dependencies (remove tmux or zsh if you don't need to install them)
./install.sh
```

### Step 2
Deploy (e.g. source aliases for .zshrc, apply oh-my-zsh settings etc..)
```bash
# Remote linux machine
./deploy.sh  
```

### Step 3
This set of dotfiles uses the powerlevel10k theme for zsh, this makes your terminal look better and adds lots of useful features, e.g. env indicators, git status etc...

Note that as the provided powerlevel10k config uses special icons it is *highly recommended* you install a custom font that supports these icons. A guide to do that is [here](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k). Alternatively you can set up powerlevel10k to not use these icons (but it won't look as good!)

This repo comes with a preconfigured powerlevel10k theme in [`./config/p10k.zsh`](./config/p10k.zsh) but you can reconfigure this by running `p10k configure` which will launch an interactive window. 


When you get to the last two options below
```
Powerlevel10k config file already exists.
Overwrite ~/git/dotfiles/config/p10k.zsh?
# Press y for YES

Apply changes to ~/.zshrc?
# Press n for NO 
```

## Getting to know these dotfiles

* Any software or command line tools you need, add them to the [install.sh](./install.sh) script. Try adding a new command line tool to the install script.
* Any new plugins or environment setup, add them to the [config/zshrc.sh](./config/zshrc.sh) script.
* Any aliases you need, add them to the [config/aliases.sh](./config/aliases.sh) script. Try adding your own alias to the bottom of the file. For example, try setting `cd1` to your most used git repo so you can just type `cd1` to get to it.
